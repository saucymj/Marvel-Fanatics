# Marvel Fanatics

## Description 

I wanted to create a full stack application where users will be able to create an account to so they can search and review their favorite Marvel characters. Similar to blogs users can say something about the characters last movie, comic, or just their character in general. During this project I learned how to connect my seeds to heroku, and succesfully connect my frontend to my backend. 

## Installation

The server requires Node.js, handlebars, materialize, express, mysql, session to have an cookies, and sequelize.
